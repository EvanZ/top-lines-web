# Top Lines Web (Vue + Vite)

## Dev setup

```bash
cd top-lines-web/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Data files are served from `/data/...` (generated by Dagster). For voting, point the frontend at the FastAPI service:

```
# .env.local
VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000
```

Run the backend with `uvicorn main:app --reload` from `top-lines-web/backend`. Votes are currently men-only.
